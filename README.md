## Get Started

To get going, you'll need a few things:

- [The Unity IDE](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
- The project code from this repo 
- A device using Tango technology, for example the [Lenovo Phab 2 Pro or Asus ZenFone AR](https://get.google.com/tango/)

Once you have the project downloaded, you need to set up the Android SDK in the Unity IDE:

- Set the Android SDK path as [explained in the Unity docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/540/Documentation/Manual/android-sdksetup.html).
- If you don't have the Android SDK downloaded you can [find it here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

That's all. You're now all set to build the project. If you run into any issues integrating the code, [this SO answer might help](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44521406/unity-project-with-mapbox-and-project-tango#answer-44524572).
