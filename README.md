# Mapbox Tango Unity example

Example which integrates Googleâ€™s Project Tango SDK with the Mapbox Unity SDK to create an augmented reality experience on an Android phone with Mapbox maps.

## Get Started

To get going, you'll need a few things:
- The Unity IDE: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
- A device using Tango technology [Lenovo Phab 2 Pro or Asus ZenFone AR](https://get.google.com/tango/)
- The project code from this repo 

Once you have the project downloaded, you need to set up the Android SDK in the Unity IDE
- [Set the Android SDK path](https://docs.unity3d.com/540/Documentation/Manual/android-sdksetup.html)
  - If you don't have the Android SDK downloaded: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

You can then [build to your device!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44521406/unity-project-with-mapbox-and-project-tango#answer-44524572)
